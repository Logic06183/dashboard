3. Click it to open the stock entry page

### Step 2: Update Stock Levels
The page shows ALL ingredients used in pizzas, organized in a grid with color-coded cards:

- 🔴 **RED** = Out of Stock (0 items)
- 🟠 **ORANGE** = Low Stock (below threshold)
- 🟢 **GREEN** = Good Stock (adequate supply)

### Step 3: Three Ways to Update Amounts

**Option 1: Quick Adjust Buttons**
- Use **+1, +10, +100** to add stock
- Use **-1, -10, -100** to reduce stock

**Option 2: Quick Set Buttons**
- Click preset amounts like "0", "100", "500", "1000" to set exact quantities

**Option 3: Direct Input**
- Type the exact amount in the number field

### Step 4: Filter & Search
- Use the **Category dropdown** to view specific types (Cheese, Meat, Vegetables, etc.)
- Use the **Search box** to find ingredients quickly by name

### Step 5: Save Your Changes
1. After updating all stock levels, click the **"Save All Changes"** button at the bottom
2. Wait for the success message
3. Done! The system automatically tracks usage as orders come in

## When to Do This
