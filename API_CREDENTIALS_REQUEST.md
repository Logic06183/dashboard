# API Credentials Needed for Automated Order System

Hey! I'm building an automated system to receive Uber Eats and Mr. D Food orders directly into our kitchen dashboard (no more manual order entry!). I need some API credentials from the accounts you set up.

## 🔐 What I Need From You

### For Uber Eats:

**Where to find these:**
1. Go to: **https://developer.uber.com/**
2. Sign in with our restaurant partner account (the one you used to set up Uber Eats)
3. Go to: **Dashboard → Apps → [John Dough's App]**
4. Look under "Settings" and "Webhooks" tabs

**Please send me:**
- ✅ **Restaurant ID** (or Store ID)
- ✅ **Client ID**
- ✅ **Client Secret**
- ✅ **Webhook Signing Secret** (if available)

*Tip: These will look like long random strings of letters and numbers*

---

### For Mr. D Food:

**Where to find these:**
1. Check your Mr. D Food partner portal/dashboard
2. Or you might need to contact Mr. D partner support: **partnersupport@mrd.co.za**
3. Tell them: "We need API access for POS integration to receive orders programmatically"

**Please send me:**
- ✅ **Store ID** (our restaurant ID on Mr. D)
- ✅ **API Key** or **Partner Token**
- ✅ **Webhook Secret** (if they provide one)

---

## 📝 How to Send Them to Me

**Option 1: Secure Message**
- Screenshot the credentials (make sure they're clear)
- WhatsApp/SMS them to me
- I'll copy them into the system and then you can delete the message

**Option 2: Email**
- Send to my email: [YOUR_EMAIL]
- I'll download and delete the email right away

**Option 3: In Person**
- Just show me on your phone/computer and I'll type them in

---

## 🤔 What if You Can't Find Them?

### For Uber Eats:
- **Option 1:** Reset credentials in the Uber Developer Dashboard
- **Option 2:** Contact Uber Eats partner support through your restaurant manager account
- **Option 3:** If you still have the original setup emails from Uber, credentials might be there

### For Mr. D Food:
- **Contact Mr. D Support:**
  - Email: partnersupport@mrd.co.za
  - Phone: Check your partner emails for their support number
  - Tell them: "We're John Dough's in Linden and we need API credentials for POS integration to receive orders programmatically into our system"

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why do you need this?**
A: So orders from Uber Eats and Mr. D automatically appear in our kitchen display instead of us typing them in manually. Saves time and reduces errors!

**Q: Is it safe to share these?**
A: Yes, I'll store them securely in our Firebase system (encrypted). I just need them once to set up the integration.

**Q: Will this affect our existing orders?**
A: No! It just adds a new way for orders to come in. Everything keeps working as normal, but now orders also flow automatically into our dashboard.

**Q: What if I already changed restaurants/owners?**
A: You might need to contact Uber Eats / Mr. D support to transfer access or get new credentials under the current ownership.

## ✅ Once I Get Them

I'll:
1. Add them to the system config (takes 5 minutes)
2. Deploy the integration
3. Test with a real order
4. Let you know it's working!

Then orders will automatically appear in our dashboard the moment they're placed. No more running back and forth or missing orders! 🎉

**Thanks! Let me know if you have any questions.**
